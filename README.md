  <h1 align="center">Wolfenstein 3D C++</h1>
</p>

I decided to make my own version of Wolfenstein 3D for my 4. semester computer science project. The game was made in 3 weeks and was my first c++ game. The game does not use ray cast rendering like the original.

The game is compiled using `Visual Studio 2017 (v141) Platform Toolkit` and `Windows SDK version 10.0.17763.0`. I use OpenGL for rendering, SOIL for textures, and Irrklang for audio.

There are some things I would have done differently today as I have learned a lot since then. The commit messages are bad, sorry about that, but feel free to have a look and take anything you find useful.
